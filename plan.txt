#Continously record values and add it to the total sum  while the record timer has not expired 
#As soon as trigger occurs set a flag to:
	1. reset the timer
	2. 
	1. take the sum and divide by a
	2. Display and trigger relavant relays
	3. reset the sum and array



Variables 
	
	RECORDING : Boolean to say if the record has started
	start_rec_time : start value since start of recording
	rec_interval_low : the duration after which recording to be started
	rec_intervel_high : the duration after which the recording stops
	

# As soon as the Sensor Triggers :
	1. set RECORDING to True after rec_interval_low ( using a new thread ) 
	2. restart the recording timer( start_rec_time ) 
# if recording :
	# if timer has not yet expired  time_passed <= rec_interval_high) : 
		1. add the values
	# if timer has expired (time_passed > rec_interval_high):
		1. calculate the average (sm/frameNo): 
		2. Classify pupae
		3. reset the sm and frameNo
		4. set RECORDING to False
